# Generic-Verification-in-Deep-Learning-System

This is the final project of the course ENEE 759I. I want to see the different factors which affect the results of the any trained deep neural netork. I begin to constrcut the basic convolutional neural network to run my test and show the rate which the factors (Angle, Shifting, and the illumination) affect the images.
> Language: TensorFlow  
> Environment: Jupyter Notebook  
> Data: CIFAR-10  
> Reference: https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials 

> Code Usage:  
cache.py, cifar10.py, dataset.py, download.py are all from reference.  
Main.ipynb is the main program for the project.
TensorFlow Test.ipynb is the test program to verify the completeness of the environment.
