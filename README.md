# Generic-Verification-in-Deep-Learning-System

This is the final project of the course ENEE 759I. I want to see the different factors which affect the results of the any trained deep neural netork. I begin to constrcut the basic convolutional neural network to run my test and show the rate which the factors (Angle, Shifting, and the illumination) affect the images.
